This is an Android logo drawn with CSS, based on the tutorial at https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Creating-Android-Logo-using-HTML-and-CSS/1394149988.

In addition to following the tutorial, I've made the following additions/customizations:

 - Use transform-origin instead of translate for maintaining element placement in animations
 - Create new :hover events for legs
 - Create new on-click (:active) events for body, head, and eyes
